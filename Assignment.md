## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program
 **What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**


**1. Concept: GitHub Pages Deployment**

**Expectation**: I thought deploying with GitHub Pages would be this super technical process with servers, terminals, and lots of config files.

**Reality**: It’s literally just pushing to the 'main' branch and enabling GitHub Pages in the repo settings. Way easier than expected.

**Impact**: Seeing my portfolio live gave me such a confidence boost! It made the whole project feel real and professional,even though I only used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**2. Concept: Pull Requests and Merging**

**Expectation**: I assumed pull requests were mostly for teams working on open-source projects—not something I'd use while coding alone.

**Reality**: PRs turned out to be super helpful, even solo. They helped me keep my changes organized and gave me space to review before merging into 'main'.

**Impact**: I opened a PR for each feature—like the homepage, about section, and contact and practiced merging cleanly (and even simulating a merge conflict!). Now I understand the whole workflow way better.


**3. Concept: Commit Messages (feat:, fix:)**

**Expectation**: I thought all commits were just casual messages like "updated stuff" or "fixed bug lo".

**Reality**: Turns out, there's an actual convention. Using `feat:`, `fix:`, and `style:` made my Git history so much cleaner and more understandable.

**Impact**: I used meaningful commits helped me track my progress and stay focused.


**4. Concept: GitHub Project Boards**

**Expectation**: I used to think GitHub project boards were only for professional devs who had big teams and perfect workflows.

**Reality**: Nope! Even as a student, it’s a game changer. The board helped me break down my big portfolio into small, manageable tasks.

**Impact**: I created a board with "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done" columns, assigned issues to each section, and watched my progress unfold visually. It made the whole thing way less overwhelming.



## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features

Include screenshots that demonstrate how you used GitHub to manage your project. For each screenshot, write a short caption explaining what it shows.

> Upload the screenshots to your GitHub repository and reference them here using Markdown image syntax:
